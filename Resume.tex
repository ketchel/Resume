\section{Projects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solar System Simulator (Java)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created an animation of the Solar System with accurate relative planet speeds.
        \item Added several buttons that changed the simulation in different ways e.g. Turn the Sun into a black hole, make the relative sizes of the planets correct
        \item Added text fields that allowed the user to type in the rotational period of any of the planets in a variety of units. The rotational speeds of the other planets would remain relatively correct at all times.
        \item This was my final project for grade 12 computer science and I had a lot of fun making it.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Gas in a box simulation (Python)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a class that produces a simulation of $N$ gas particles, approximated as circles of radius $r$, trapped in a 2D box.
        \item The simulation could be used to produce a visual simulation of the gas in the box.
        \item The class had several attributes such as the mass of each particle, particle radius, temperature, or box size.
        \item By varying these attributes and plotting the results, certain physical laws can be demonstrated, e.g. showing the particle velocities follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Star simulation (Python)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created functions that would enable us to solve the equations of stellar structure.
        \item These results can be used to simulate several different types of star with the only argument required being the central temperature.
        \item The make\_star function can be run several times to produce a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung\%E2\%80\%93Russell_diagram}  {\underline{ Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram}}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Spectral Inference Networks (Python)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Combines spectral methods for solving differential equations and neural networks.
        \item Can be used to approximate eigenfunctions of the Laplacian.
        \item Potential future applications include solving quantum mechanics or fluid dynamic problems.
        \item Worked with three others to create a new implementation in Jax based on \underline{\href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02215.pdf}{this paper}}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item NBA Statistical Analysis (Python/SQL)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a web scraper in Python to obtain NBA statistics from basketball reference and store them in SQL tables.
        \item Ended with a SQL database containing all major statistics since the 1950s and all play-by-play data since play-by-play data started being recorded.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
